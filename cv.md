## About me
My name is Ksenia , I am 24 years old Junior Frontend Developer. I have more than 5 years experience of teaching Russian and English, including working abroad for more than a year. While working as a teacher I started to learn Frontend development and I successfully finished a course on HTML Academy and got a cetificate that I'm a frontend developer. Also I had an internship for half a year in the same oraganisation. After the internship I almost next day got the job as a frontend developer in a small Web studio called "Webenergy", where I've been working for 7 month now. 
I understand that I can achive and learn much more, so I decided to take this course. I'm quite a fast learner If I have practice. If I don't understand something I try to google it first then I ask for help. I don't give up and try to do everything well. I'm good at team work, I've worked together with Backend developers, designers and SEO specialists.

## What I know and can use
* HTML
* CSS (Sass, Less)
* BEM
* JavaScript (Fundamentals, ES6+, DOM)
* Jquery 
* Git/GitHub
* Photoshop, Figma
